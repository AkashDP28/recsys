Non-rigid deformation makes it difficultto remove mismatches because no parametric transformation can be found. Tosolve this problem, we first propose an algorithm based on the re-weighting and1-point RANSAC strategy (R1P-RNSC), which is a parametric method under areasonable assumption that the non-rigid deformation can be approximatelyrepresented by multiple locally rigid transformations. R1P-RNSC is fast butsuffers from a drawback that the local smoothing information cannot be takeninto account. Then, we propose a non-parametric algorithm based on theexpectation maximization algorithm and dual quaternion (EMDQ) representation togenerate the smooth deformation field. The two algorithms compensate for thedrawbacks of each other. Specifically, EMDQ needs good initial values providedby R1P-RNSC, and R1P-RNSC needs EMDQ for refinement. Experimental results withreal-world data demonstrate that the combination of the two algorithms has thebest accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods, which can handle upto 85% of outliers in real-time. The ability to generate dense deformationfield from sparse matches with outliers in real-time makes the proposedalgorithms have many potential applications, such as non-rigid registration andSLAM.

With the assistance ofedge servers, user equipments (UEs) are able to run deep neural network (DNN)based AI applications, which are generally resource-hungry andcompute-intensive, such that an individual UE can hardly afford by itself inreal time. However the resources in each individual edge server are typicallylimited. Therefore, any resource optimization involving edge servers is bynature a resource-constrained optimization problem and needs to be tackled insuch realistic context. Motivated by this observation, we investigate theoptimization problem of DNN partitioning (an emerging DNN offloading scheme) ina realistic multi-user resource-constrained condition that rarely considered inprevious works. Despite the extremely large solution space, we reveal severalproperties of this specific optimization problem of joint multi-UE DNNpartitioning and computational resource allocation. We propose an algorithmcalled Iterative Alternating Optimization (IAO) that can achieve the optimalsolution in polynomial time. In addition, we present rigorous theoreticanalysis of our algorithm in terms of time complexity and performance underrealistic estimation error. Moreover, we build a prototype that implements ourframework and conduct extensive experiments using realistic DNN models, whoseresults demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.

These are closely related to the utilization ofmulti-level and multi-scale features. In this paper, we propose the aggregateinteraction modules to integrate the features from adjacent levels, in whichless noise is introduced because of only using small up-/down-sampling rates.To obtain more efficient multi-scale features from the integrated features, theself-interaction modules are embedded in each decoder unit. Besides, the classimbalance issue caused by the scale variation weakens the effect of the binarycross entropy loss and results in the spatial inconsistency of the predictions.Therefore, we exploit the consistency-enhanced loss to highlight thefore-/back-ground difference and preserve the intra-class consistency.Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposedmethod without any post-processing performs favorably against 23state-of-the-art approaches.

This study is a bid to suggesting different algorithms andapproaches for the reduction of dimensionality of such microarray datasets.This study exploits the matrix-like structure of such microarray data and usesa popular technique called Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to reducethe dimensionality, primarily in the field of biological data. Classificationaccuracies are then compared for these algorithms. This technique gives anaccuracy of 98%.    ","Quantitative Biology,Quantitative Methods",,2020-20-20

The problem is challenging because differentillumination conditions, bleeding, smoke and occlusions can reduce algorithmrobustness. At present labelled data for training deep learning models is stilllacking for semantic surgical instrument segmentation and in this paper we showthat it may be possible to use robot kinematic data coupled with laparoscopicimages to alleviate the labelling problem. We propose a new deep learning basedmodel for parallel processing of both laparoscopic and simulation images forrobust segmentation of surgical tools. Due to the lack of laparoscopic framesannotated with both segmentation ground truth and kinematic information a newcustom dataset was generated using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and is madeavailable.
